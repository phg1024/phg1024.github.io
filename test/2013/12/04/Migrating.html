    <p class="meta">04 Dec 2013</p>

    <div class="post">
        <p>The website is slowly shaping into the one I&#39;ve always wanted to build: static(but also interactive),
  simple, and most importantly, easy to maintain. Because I have had enough with my previous website. Written
  from scratch surely gives me total control over the pages, but that wasn&#39;t exactly what I needed. Updating
  the website became a pain in the ass for me soon enough, and I just didn&#39;t bother to switch to a different
  way -- actually the right way of doing it.</p>

<p>It first occurred to me that I could actually put my site on <a href="http://github.io">github.io</a> and save a few
  bucks for coffee after visiting some really cool pages hosted on <a href="http://github.io">github.io</a>. Too bad
  I could not recovery those links from my memory :( But the good part is I knew what I wanted and I had just
  found it!</p>

<p>There is not much to talk about for rest of the story: I simply went through the tutorial of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>
  and started building my version 5 website, feeling excited!</p>
